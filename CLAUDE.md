## Project Overview

This is a newly created repository called "GoLani_TranslationTools" focused on translation tools. The repository is currently in its initial state with only a LICENSE file (MIT License).

## Repository Status

This is a fresh repository with minimal content:
- Only contains a LICENSE file
- No source code files yet
- No configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- No README or documentation
- Main branch with single initial commit

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository without established tooling, development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen for the translation tools. Common patterns for translation tool projects include:

- Python-based tools (likely using requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml)
- JavaScript/Node.js tools (likely using package.json)
- Desktop applications (possibly using frameworks like Electron, Tkinter, or Qt)

## Future Development Notes

As this repository grows, consider adding:
- Project configuration files appropriate to the chosen technology stack
- Source code organization following best practices for the selected language/framework
- Build and test automation
- Documentation for users and contributors
